# Blockbench Animation

Create animations for 3D models using Blockbench MCP tools.

## Rig and Motion Decisions

Confirm the format's animation support and intended exporter before animating. Group-based `bone_rigging` and `manage_keyframes` operate on Blockbench groups; native armature bones and vertex weights are a separate rig type with their own tools. Do not assume these group tools animate an `ArmatureBone` merely because it has a similar name. See [MCP overview](../blockbench-mcp-overview/SKILL.md) for discovery and [format/delivery guidance](../blockbench-use/references/formats-and-delivery.md) for target requirements.

Place pivots at joints and build outward through the hierarchy. Block important poses and timing first, then refine weight, contact, anticipation and follow-through as the action requires. Smooth interpolation can overshoot, and mechanical motion can be continuous; choose curves to suit the movement rather than assigning one interpolation to a whole genre. The official [Blockbench overview](https://blockbench.net/wiki/guides/blockbench-overview-tips/) explains hierarchy, pivots and timeline controls.

Animation times are seconds. Timeline FPS controls snapping, not a universal game playback rate or a guarantee that an exporter samples at that rate. Preserve the target format's rules. Inspect start, extrema and in-between poses, and the loop seam for repeating clips; equal endpoint values alone do not guarantee smooth velocity or foot contact.

## Available Tools

| `animation_timeline` | Control playback, time, FPS, loop settings |
| `batch_keyframe_operations` | Batch operations: offset, scale, reverse, mirror |
| `animation_copy_paste` | Copy animation data between bones/animations |

## Quick Start

### Create a Continuous Rotation

Check `get_capabilities` for `format.features.animation_mode=true` and use `list_outline` to identify the existing bone/group. Animate a shared parent group to rotate a multi-mesh object together; place that group's pivot at the intended center before adding keyframes. Preserve the user's existing project and geometry.

The examples use tool-call pseudocode. Bind `spin.uuid` to the UUID returned by `create_animation`; do not invent animation IDs or assume a name prefix. `bones` is required, including when creating an empty animation for subsequent keyframe calls.

```
spin = create_animation: name="spin", animation_length=4.0, loop=true, bones={}
manage_keyframes: animation_id=spin.uuid, action="create",
  bone_name="logo_root", channel="rotation", keyframes=[
    {time: 0, values: [0, 0, 0], interpolation: "linear"},
    {time: 1, values: [0, 90, 0], interpolation: "linear"},
    {time: 2, values: [0, 180, 0], interpolation: "linear"},
    {time: 3, values: [0, 270, 0], interpolation: "linear"},
    {time: 4, values: [0, 360, 0], interpolation: "linear"}
  ]
animation_timeline: animation_id=spin.uuid, action="set_time", time=1.0
capture_screenshot
animation_timeline: animation_id=spin.uuid, action="play"
```

Replace `logo_root` with a group returned by `list_outline`. This example turns around the Y axis once every four seconds; use Z for an in-plane spin of a logo lying in the XY plane. Quarter-turn keys preserve the intended path in quaternion-interpolated formats where equivalent orientations or a 180-degree interval can make the direction ambiguous. Inspect intermediate times and the loop boundary before playback and after export.

### Animation Channels

- `position` - [x, y, z] offset
- `rotation` - [x, y, z] degrees
- `scale` - [x, y, z] or uniform number

`manage_keyframes.values` accepts either a three-axis array or a number expanded across all three axes. Prefer an explicit array when axes differ, especially for rotations. Numeric tool channels do not imply support for arbitrary Molang, Hytale UV-offset/visibility, or effect channels. Use the corresponding specialized tool or supported native workflow.

### Interpolation Types

- `linear` - Constant rate
- `catmullrom` - Smooth spline
- `bezier` - Custom curves
- `step` - Instant change

## Common Workflows

### Walk Cycle (1 second)

This is a minimal timing example for existing leg bones, not a completed walk. Check planted-foot contact, knee motion, body movement and limb clearance in the actual model before refining the cycle.

```
walk = create_animation: name="walk", animation_length=1.0, loop=true, bones={
  "leg_left": [
    {time: 0, rotation: [30, 0, 0]},
    {time: 0.5, rotation: [-30, 0, 0]},
    {time: 1.0, rotation: [30, 0, 0]}
  ],
  "leg_right": [
    {time: 0, rotation: [-30, 0, 0]},
    {time: 0.5, rotation: [30, 0, 0]},
    {time: 1.0, rotation: [-30, 0, 0]}
  ]
}
```

### Smooth Curves

```
animation_graph_editor: animation_id=walk.uuid,
  bone_name="leg_left", channel="rotation", action="smooth"
```

### Batch Timing Adjustment

Batch operations use the active animation. `selection="all"` includes hidden/collapsed animators, so use `selected`, `range`, or `pattern` when the request covers fewer keyframes. Confirm the active animation before editing. Timing operations reject negative/out-of-range times and duplicate times within a channel.

```
batch_keyframe_operations: operation="scale", selection="all",
  parameters={scale_factor: 2.0}  # Double keyframe times around zero
animation_timeline: animation_id=walk.uuid, action="set_length", length=2.0
```

`scale` scales keyframe times around `scale_pivot` (default zero). `offset_values` adds numeric XYZ components; `mirror` negates the requested component and is not an anatomical left/right retargeting operation. Numeric value edits require transform keyframes with one data point; use native tools for expressions or pre/post values. Current batch edits validate before applying one undoable transaction.

### Bake Numeric Curves

In the current source plugin, `operation="bake"` samples original continuous numeric transform curves before inserting linear keys. It affects each selected channel between its first and last selected times, retains existing sample times/endpoints, restores the playhead, and caps the total at 10,000 samples.

```
batch_keyframe_operations: operation="bake", selection="selected",
  parameters={bake_interval: 0.05}
```

Select at least two times per intended channel. The interval is seconds (minimum 0.001); choose it for the motion/export target. Expressions, effect channels, step curves and pre/post data points are rejected. Baking only part of a smooth channel can alter adjacent interpolation because the boundary keys become linear; bake a whole channel when continuity outside a selected span must be preserved. Inspect sampled poses and destination output before relying on the bake.

## Bone Rigging

### Copy Between Existing Bones

The current `animation_copy_paste` preserves native transform data points, expressions, pre/post values, interpolation and detached Bezier handles. Copy is read-only with respect to model/history; paste is one undoable animation edit.

```
animation_copy_paste: action="copy", source={animation: walk.uuid,
  bone: "leg_left", channels: ["rotation"], time_range: {start: 0, end: 1}}
animation_copy_paste: action="mirror_paste", target={animation: walk.uuid,
  bone: "leg_right", time_offset: 0, mirror_axis: "x"}
```

Paste uses exact unsnapped timestamps and replaces existing keys at the same channel/time. Inspect the target before overwriting it. `mirror_paste` uses the native spatial mirror: position negates the chosen axis, rotation negates the other two axes, and scale is preserved; curve handles follow the mirrored values. This differs from batch `mirror`, which negates one numeric component. Inspect the mirrored pose against the rig's actual pivots and orientation; copying channels does not retarget a differently proportioned skeleton. Clipboard contents persist until the next copy or plugin reload.

### Create Bone Structure

```
bone_rigging: action="create", bone_data={name: "spine", origin: [0, 12, 0]}
bone_rigging: action="create", bone_data={name: "head", origin: [0, 24, 0], parent: "spine"}
```

### Set Pivot Point

```
bone_rigging: action="set_pivot", bone_data={name: "arm_left", origin: [4, 22, 0]}
```

## Timeline Control

Pass the returned animation UUID as `animation_id` to target a timeline explicitly. Omitting it uses the selected animation; `create_animation` selects its result. Batch operations use the active animation, so confirm its selection first. They may extend length to contain moved keys; set the requested final clip length explicitly when timing changes.

```
animation_timeline: animation_id=spin.uuid, action="set_fps", fps=60
animation_timeline: animation_id=spin.uuid, action="loop", loop_mode="loop"  # or "once", "hold"
animation_timeline: animation_id=spin.uuid, action="set_time", time=0.5
animation_timeline: animation_id=spin.uuid, action="play"
```

## Tips

- Use `list_outline` to see available bones before animating
- Set up bone hierarchy first with `bone_rigging` before adding keyframes
- Use `catmullrom` for smooth paths when appropriate, then inspect for overshoot
- Use `step` for intentional holds and abrupt pose changes
- For exact rotation values, use `manage_keyframes` with explicit per-axis values; inspect copied or mirrored poses as well as their tool result

## Export Verification

Preserve an editable project when the handoff needs one. Discover the actual animation export workflow: a model codec does not necessarily export separate animation files, controllers or effects. Bedrock animation JSON and Hytale `.blockyanim` assets must accompany the appropriate model when requested. Verify names, duration, interpolation and loop behavior in the destination when available.

Molang expressions require format/runtime support; glTF and FBX cannot retain arbitrary expression-driven behavior. Baking can approximate a chosen time sequence but cannot preserve a variable-driven state machine. The current batch bake supports numeric curves only; expression baking requires an appropriate native workflow. See [Blockbench animation expressions](https://blockbench.net/wiki/guides/animation-expressions/).
